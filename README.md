# telegram-bugs - and their Privacy Policy for reading directly on Telegram
There are many "bugs" in the system (some "to prevent spam"). - Two issues are glaringly obvious.

## Largest issue
✖️ The server is still closed source

## Still fairly large issue
✖️ Registration only possible with the official Telegram app
<br>✖️ Registration process will often send a phone call to your phone instead of an SMS
<br>✖️ There's no IV preview of the official Privacy Policy page. - _Is that by desire?_

Don't fret, there's this as alternative to properly view it in Telegram:
<br>[@TG_PrivacyGroupChat](https://t.me/TG_PrivacyGroupChat) or head straight to
<br>[@PrivacyPolicyTelegram](https://t.me/PrivacyPolicyTelegram) if you wanna discuss the content of the privacy policy.

## Smaller issues
✖️ Topics aren't available for channels
<br>✖️ Topics can't have sub-topics
